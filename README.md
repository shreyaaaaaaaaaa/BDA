As part of this project, we have created a NBA Players Analysis model  which would make use of 21 player related attributes for each of the 12305 records. We have tried to leverage data to find hidden insights and patterns to benefit the team. We have tried to investigate  the link between a playerâ€™s attributes and its performance. A wide range of machine learning approaches have been implemented to tackle these problems.
